# My collection of SQL Server Scripts

This is a repo I use to keep SQL server related scripts, tips and tricks in one place.

Some are my own, others are copied from others. I try to remember to credit in the scripts.

# Maintenance

## [CreateDbUser.sql](https://github.com/kjlibsol/sql-server-scripts/blob/master/CreateDbUser.sql)

Create a new user in masterdb and make it dbo on a client db

## [Backup All Databases](https://github.com/kjlibsol/sql-server-scripts/blob/master/Backup_All_Databases.sql)

Backup all databases on server to a folder on the server.
 
## [Show the size of all tables](https://github.com/kjlibsol/sql-server-scripts/blob/master/TableSizes.sql)

Showing table sizes in SQL Server Management Studio does not always work with Azure. This script gets the job done no matter what.
